IntradayAurumPulsePro.mq5  
Signal-Based Adaptive Trailing Bot for XAUUSDm (Gold)  
_Created by Rana Ammar Yasir_

📌 Overview

IntradayAurumPulsePro is a fully autonomous, broker-independent MetaTrader 5 (MT5) Expert Advisor (EA) built for trading the Gold market (`XAUUSDm`). Designed for high-precision intraday trading, this bot uses a combination of RSI, MA, CCI, and ATR indicators to identify high-probability entry signals and dynamically manages trades with adaptive trailing logic.  

It is a single-file bot, and no additional instruction manual, dependency list, or separate configuration is required. All essential information is documented below.

- ✅ RSI + CCI + MA Multi-Indicator Signal Engine.
- ✅ ATR-based dynamic Stop Loss (SL).
- ✅ Auto-Adaptive Trailing Take Profit (TP).
- ✅ Position filtering using equity thresholds.
- ✅ Smart lot sizing logic based on balance.

Strategy Breakdown

IntradayAurumPulsePro uses a multi-layered logic structure:

1. **Signal Generation**:
   - **RSI**, **CCI**, and **Moving Average** are used to determine trade entries.
   - Entry logic adapts based on the current cycle (entry #0 to entry #4).

2. **Position Entry**:
   - Up to **5 entries per cycle**, based on signal quality.
   - Adaptive lot size calculation based on current equity level.
   - Automated Stop Loss is set using **2x ATR**.

3. **Trailing Logic**:
   - If profit exceeds $20 → Secure partial profit via SL adjustment.
   - If profit exceeds $30 and `UseAdaptiveTP = true` → Activate smart trailing.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Entry allowed only within trading hours.
   - Trade volume adjusts based on equity:
     - `< $200`: 0.01 lots
     - `< $300`: 0.01 lots
     - `< $400`: 0.02 lots
     - `< $500`: 0.03 lots
     - `>= $500`: 0.02 lots
